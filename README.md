In order to help financial institutions determine credible farmers, Credit Wise is designed to give credit score to each farmer to ensure efficient credit decision making and disbursal of agricultural loans based on the credit score. The credit score is calculated using the FICO’s  Standard, farmer’s behavior and credit performance.
